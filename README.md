# User Enrolment Manager â€“ Take Home Task

## ðŸ§  Task Overview

Youâ€™ve been provided with a simple PHP framework simulating Moodle-like users and courses. Your task is to implement an `enrolment_manager` class that supports enrolling and unenrolling users from courses and retrieving enrolment information.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Implement the following methods in `enrolment_manager.php`:
  - `public function enrol_user(int $userid, int $courseid): void`
  - `public function unenrol_user(int $userid, int $courseid): void`
  - `public function get_user_courses(int $userid): array`

- Handle and guard against:
  - Duplicate enrolments
  - Unenrolling users not enrolled in a course
  - Invalid user or course IDs

- Ensure your implementation:
  - Uses the provided `user` and `course` classes
  - Passes all PHPUnit tests
  - Has unit tests to cover the above scenarios
  - All commits are logical and include a sane message
    - https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/

- There is no need to include a datasource like a database in the application.

## âœ… Requirements

- PHP 8.0+
- PHPUnit (via Composer)
- Your code **must be tested** with `enrolment_manager_test.php`
